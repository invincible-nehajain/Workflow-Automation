📊 Customer Operations Automation with Retool
Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and automate customer operations workflows using Retool to streamline request intake, triage, and cross-functional communication. The solution connects data, workflows, and Slack notifications to reduce manual effort, improve visibility, and accelerate resolution times.

Built to simulate real-world operations challenges in high-growth B2B environments, this app focuses on turning ad-hoc requests into structured, repeatable systems.

🧩 What This App Does
1. Centralized Order & Request Visibility

Displays customer orders and requests from a Retool Database in a searchable, paginated table

Surfaces key attributes such as customer name, product, quantity, unit price, and order date

Enables operations teams to quickly assess volume, priority, and workload

2. Structured Intake via Form Builder

Custom form interface for capturing new requests with required field validation

Ensures clean, consistent data entry (product, destination, order date, quantity)

Reduces back-and-forth and incomplete submissions

3. Automated Workflow Logic

Workflow evaluates incoming data (e.g., request volume thresholds)

Uses conditional branching to determine next steps

Demonstrates how one-off decisions can be converted into rules-based automation

4. Slack Integration for Real-Time Alerts

Automatically posts updates to Slack channels when conditions are met

Keeps Product, Engineering, and Operations aligned without manual follow-ups

Reduces response time and improves cross-functional communication

🎯 Why This Matters (Operations Impact)

This project reflects how an early operations hire can:

Turn reactive firefighting into repeatable workflows

Create visibility into request volume, capacity, and bottlenecks

Reduce manual coordination across teams

Lay the foundation to scale from 10 → 100+ customers without linear headcount growth
